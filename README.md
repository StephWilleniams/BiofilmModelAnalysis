# Code: Identifiability, Sensitivity, and Genetic Algorithms in Bacterial Biofilm Selection Models
## Author: Stephen Williams

The code here follows through the calculations present in https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20219. The files are organised by the concept being explored, and their order follows the sequence in which they are introduced in the text.
Where possible, the code is presented in the Julia programming language; the author utilised VSCode, along with the Julia plugin, for editing.
The remainder of the code is executed using Python and MATLAB.
